  "questions": [
    "How to perform a full trajectory analysis using Monocle3 in R?",
    "What to do when Galaxy's Monocle tools are not enough?",
    "How to assign cell types to the clusters?",
    "How can I infer lineage relationships between clusters, without a time series?",
    "How to perform batch correction and differential expression analysis in Monocle?"
  ],
  "objectives": [
    "Identify which operations to perform on an AnnData object to obtain the files needed for Monocle and why to do it this way",
    "Become familiar with Monocle3 functions in R and be able to switch between Galaxy and R fluently",
    "Learn about steps that can only be performed in R, but not with Galaxy tools",
    "Follow the Monocle3 workflow and choose the right parameter values",
    "Compare the outputs from Scanpy, Monocle in Galaxy and Monocle in R",
    "Learn about differential expression analysis methods"
  ],
  "time_estimation": "2H",
  "key_points": [
    "Being able to switch between Galaxy and R when using Monocle is very useful, particularly when you need to modify the CDS object manually.",
    "Monocle3 in R gives more flexibility when it comes to differential expression analysis and plotting, but Galaxy offers great reproducibility and ease of analysis.",
    "Comparing the output of several different methods applied on the same dataset might be useful to confirm the results, to ensure that the findings are reliable and even sometimes to find a new piece of information."
